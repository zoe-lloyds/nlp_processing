Active Periods: An active period is a continuous block of time where a person is actively sending messages without a significant break. The idea is that if there is a long enough gap between messages (e.g., more than 5 minutes), it is considered a new active period. This helps in estimating how much time the person spent actively messaging as opposed to just sending messages sporadically throughout the day.
The summary table provides an overview of the messaging activity of a specific person over a period of time. The table includes the following columns:

Date: The date on which the messages were sent. This column is derived from the Timestamp of each message, and it groups all messages sent on the same day.

TotalActiveTime: The total active time spent messaging on each day. This is calculated by summing the time differences between consecutive messages sent by the person on that day. It represents the total duration of time actively spent in messaging conversations.

MessageCount: The total number of messages sent by the person on each day. This column provides a count of all messages sent by the person to any recipient(s) on the specified date.

WorkingDayHours: This column represents the standard number of working hours in a day, which is set to 7 hours by default. This column is constant for each row in the table.

ProportionOfDayMessaging: The proportion of the working day spent messaging. This is calculated by dividing the TotalActiveTime by the total working hours in a day (7 hours). It shows the fraction of the working day spent in active messaging.

MostMessagedPerson: The person who received the most messages from the specified person on each day. This column identifies the recipient who was most frequently messaged by the person on the given date.

The table provides insights into the messaging behavior of a person, such as:

How much time they spend messaging each day.
The total number of messages sent daily.
The proportion of the working day spent in messaging.
Identifying key communication partners (most messaged persons).

To explain the table containing flagged messages to an investigator without delving into the technical details of DistilBERT, you can focus on the practical aspects of what the table represents and how it was created. Here’s a concise and clear way to describe the table:

### Description of the Flagged Messages Table

The table presents messages that have been flagged as potentially important or concerning based on two criteria:

1. **Keyword Matching**: Messages containing specific words or phrases of interest, such as "meeting" or "call me," are included. These keywords were chosen to identify instances where people discussed meeting or calling each other, which might be relevant to the investigation.

2. **Content Analysis**: An advanced text analysis tool was used to automatically identify messages that might be inappropriate or significant. This tool has been trained to recognize patterns in language that are indicative of such content, helping to highlight messages that might warrant closer examination.

### How to Read the Table

- **Columns**:
  - **From**: The sender of the message.
  - **To**: The recipient of the message.
  - **Timestamp**: The date and time when the message was sent.
  - **Message**: The content of the message.
  - **Flagged By**: Indicates the method used to flag the message:
    - **Keyword**: Flagged because it contains one of the specified keywords.
    - **Content Analysis**: Flagged by the advanced text analysis tool.

### Purpose

This table helps to quickly identify messages that might be of interest based on their content. By focusing on flagged messages, you can more efficiently review communications that could be relevant to the investigation.

This explanation focuses on the practical aspects of what the table shows and how it was created, avoiding the need to explain the technical details of the DistilBERT model. It ensures that the investigator understands the purpose and significance of the flagged messages.

**Included Files and Descriptions:**

1. **Flagged Messages Table**:
   - **File Name**: `Flagged_Messages.xlsx`
   - **Description**: This file contains messages that have been flagged based on two criteria:
     - **Keyword Matching**: Messages containing specific words or phrases such as "meeting" or "call me".
     - **Content Analysis**: Messages identified by an advanced text analysis tool as potentially inappropriate or significant.

2. **Daily Messaging Behavior**:
   - **File Name**: `Daily_Messaging_Behavior.xlsx`
   - **Description**: This file provides insights into the messaging behavior of the person of interest, including:
     - **Total Messages Sent Daily**: The number of messages sent each day.
     - **Total Active Time Messaging**: The amount of time spent messaging each day.
     - **Proportion of Working Day Messaging**: The proportion of the working day spent on messaging activities.

3. **Key Communication Partners**:
   - **File Name**: `Key_Communication_Partners.xlsx`
   - **Description**: This file identifies the most frequently messaged individuals by the person of interest, highlighting their key communication partners.

4. **Visualizations**:

   - **Description**: This document includes various visualizations to help understand the messaging behavior:
     - **Bar Chart**: Showing daily message counts.
     - **Line Chart**: Depicting total active time spent messaging each day.
     - **Pie Chart**: Illustrating the proportion of the working day spent messaging.
     - **Heatmap**: Visualizing the hourly distribution of messages sent throughout the day.

5. **Communication Graph**:
   - **File Name**: `Communication_Graph.png`
   - **Description**: A network graph visualizing the person of interest and the individuals they communicated with, along with the count of messages exchanged.

6. **Pair Messaging Files**:
   - **File Names**:
     - `Pair_Messages_PersonA.xlsx`
     - `Pair_Messages_PersonB.xlsx`
     - `Pair_Messages_PersonC.xlsx`
     - `Pair_Messages_PersonD.xlsx`
   - **Description**: These files contain detailed messaging logs between the person of interest and their most frequently messaged contacts. Each file corresponds to a specific contact, providing a comprehensive view of their communications.

The folder containing all the files can be accessed via the attached link: [Insert link to the folder]

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further analysis on any aspect of the messaging behavior. I am available for a meeting to discuss these findings in detail if needed.
